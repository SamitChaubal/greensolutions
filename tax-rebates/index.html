  <h1>What is a government issued tax rebate?</h1>
  <ul>
    <li><h4>A government-issued tax rebate for green energy is a financial incentive aimed at encouraging investment in renewable energy sources and energy-efficient technologies. These rebates serve as tools to promote sustainability, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and decrease reliance on fossil fuels. Typically, they come in the form of Investment Tax Credits (ITC) or Production Tax Credits (PTC), allowing individuals or businesses to deduct a portion of the cost of installing renewable energy systems from their federal income taxes or providing tax credits for electricity generated from eligible renewable sources. Additionally, governments may offer rebates for purchasing energy-efficient appliances, sales tax exemptions for green energy technologies, or property tax incentives for renewable energy installations. These measures, tailored to specific eligibility criteria and limitations, aim to enhance the affordability and attractiveness of green energy technologies, fostering their adoption and contributing to environmental sustainability efforts.</h4></li>

        <li><p><b><i></i>Incentive:</i> The federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC) allows homeowners and businesses to deduct a percentage of the cost of installing solar panels from their federal taxes.
        <i>Percentage:</i> The ITC originally offered a 26% credit for systems installed in 2020-2022. It decreased to 22% for systems installed in 2023 and is expected to reduce further in subsequent years.
        <i>Impact:</i> According to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), the ITC has helped drive significant growth in the U.S. solar industry. In 2020, the residential solar market alone added 3.1 gigawatts (GW) of solar capacity, a 7% increase over the previous year.</b></p></li>

      <li><p><b>Many states and local governments offer rebates or grants to incentivize solar installations. For instance, California's Self-Generation Incentive Program (SGIP) provides rebates for qualifying energy storage systems, including those paired with solar.</b></p></li>
      <li><p><b>According to data from the Database of State Incentives for Renewables & Efficiency (DSIRE), state and local incentives have contributed to the growth of residential solar installations. As of 2021, California led the nation with over 10 GW of installed residential solar capacity.</b></p></li>
