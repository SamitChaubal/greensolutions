      <h2>What is a government issued tax rebate?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>A government-issued tax rebate for green energy is a financial incentive aimed at encouraging investment
            in
            renewable energy sources and energy-efficient technologies. These rebates serve as tools to promote
            sustainability, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and decrease reliance on fossil fuels. Typically, they come
            in
            the form of Investment Tax Credits (ITC) or Production Tax Credits (PTC), allowing individuals or businesses
            to
            deduct a portion of the cost of installing renewable energy systems from their federal income taxes or
            providing
            tax credits for electricity generated from eligible renewable sources. Additionally, governments may offer
            rebates for purchasing energy-efficient appliances, sales tax exemptions for green energy technologies, or
            property tax incentives for renewable energy installations. These measures, tailored to specific eligibility
            criteria and limitations, aim to enhance the affordability and attractiveness of green energy technologies,
            fostering their adoption and contributing to environmental sustainability efforts.</p>

      <h3>Production Tax Credits (PTCs):</h3>
      <p><b>
          <ul>
            <li>In the United States, the PTC for wind energy has historically provided a tax credit of $0.023 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity produced from qualified wind facilities.</li>
            <br>
            <li>According to the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA), PTCs have been a significant driver of wind energy development in the U.S., contributing to the rapid growth of wind capacity over the past few decades.</li>
          </ul>

    <div class="column">
      <h3>Investment Tax Credits (ITCs):</h3>
      <p>
        <b>
        <ul>
          <li>The ITC for renewable energy projects in the U.S. has typically provided a tax credit equal to a percentage of eligible investment costs. For wind energy projects, the ITC has been 26% or 30% of eligible costs, depending on when construction began.</li>
          <br>
          <li>According to the U.S. Department of Energy, the ITC has helped to attract private investment in wind energy projects, spurring job creation and economic development in communities across the country. </li>

      <h3>Feed-in Tariffs (FiTs):</h3>
      <p>
        <b>
          <ul>
            <li>Feed-in tariffs vary by country and region. For example, Germany implemented a successful FiT system known as the Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG), which guarantees fixed prices for renewable electricity fed into the grid. These rates are typically higher than market prices and are guaranteed for a set period, providing stability and predictability for wind energy producers.</li>
            <br>
            <li>According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), FiTs have been instrumental in driving renewable energy deployment globally, including wind power, by providing long-term revenue certainty and reducing investment risks for developers.
