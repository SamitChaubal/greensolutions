  <h1>What is a government issued tax rebate?</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4>A government-issued tax rebate for green energy is a financial incentive aimed at encouraging investment in
        renewable energy sources and energy-efficient technologies. These rebates serve as tools to promote
        sustainability, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and decrease reliance on fossil fuels. Typically, they come in
        the form of Investment Tax Credits (ITC) or Production Tax Credits (PTC), allowing individuals or businesses to
        deduct a portion of the cost of installing renewable energy systems from their federal income taxes or providing
        tax credits for electricity generated from eligible renewable sources. Additionally, governments may offer
        rebates for purchasing energy-efficient appliances, sales tax exemptions for green energy technologies, or
        property tax incentives for renewable energy installations. These measures, tailored to specific eligibility
        criteria and limitations, aim to enhance the affordability and attractiveness of green energy technologies,
        fostering their adoption and contributing to environmental sustainability efforts.</h4>

      <h3>Investment Tax Credit (ITC):</h3>
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><b><i>Description:</i> The PTC provides a per-kilowatt-hour tax credit for the first ten years of a wind project's operation.
        <i>Rate:</i> The PTC rate for wind projects has varied over the years. As of my last update, the PTC rate for wind projects that began construction in 2020 was 60% per kilowatt-hour.
        <i>Impact:</i> According to the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA), the PTC has played a crucial role in the growth of the U.S. wind industry, incentivizing the development of wind projects and driving down costs. It has helped the U.S. become a global leader in wind energy production, supporting job creation and economic growth in rural communities.</b></p>

      <h3>Production Tax Credit (PTC):</h3>
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><b><i>Description:</i> The ITC allows taxpayers to deduct a percentage of the qualified investment in a wind
            power project from their federal taxes.
        <i>Rate:</i> The ITC originally offered a 26% credit for systems installed in 2020-2022. It decreased to 22% for
        systems installed in 2023 and is expected to reduce further in subsequent years.
        <i>Impact:</i> According to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), the ITC has helped drive significant
        growth in the U.S. solar industry. In 2020, the residential solar market alone added 3.1 gigawatts (GW) of solar
        capacity, a 7% increase over the previous year.</b></p>

      <h3>Local Utility Programs:</h3>
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><b><i>Description:</i> Some local utility companies offer incentives or rebates for customers who install renewable energy systems, including wind turbines.
        <i>Programs:</i> These programs may include buy-back rates for excess electricity generated by wind turbines or upfront rebates for installation.
        <i>Impact:</i> Local utility programs can provide additional financial incentives for wind power installations, making renewable energy more accessible and affordable for homeowners and businesses.</b></p>
