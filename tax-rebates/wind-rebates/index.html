      <h2>What is a government issued tax rebate?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h4>A government-issued tax rebate for green energy is a financial incentive aimed at encouraging investment
            in
            renewable energy sources and energy-efficient technologies. These rebates serve as tools to promote
            sustainability, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and decrease reliance on fossil fuels. Typically, they come
            in
            the form of Investment Tax Credits (ITC) or Production Tax Credits (PTC), allowing individuals or businesses
            to
            deduct a portion of the cost of installing renewable energy systems from their federal income taxes or
            providing
            tax credits for electricity generated from eligible renewable sources. Additionally, governments may offer
            rebates for purchasing energy-efficient appliances, sales tax exemptions for green energy technologies, or
            property tax incentives for renewable energy installations. These measures, tailored to specific eligibility
            criteria and limitations, aim to enhance the affordability and attractiveness of green energy technologies,
            fostering their adoption and contributing to environmental sustainability efforts.</h4>

      <h3>Production Tax Credits (PTCs):</h3>
      <p><b>
          <ul>
            <li>In the United States, the PTC for wind energy has historically provided a tax credit of $0.023 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity produced from qualified wind facilities.</li>
            <li>According to the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA), PTCs have been a significant driver of wind energy development in the U.S., contributing to the rapid growth of wind capacity over the past few decades.</li>

      <h3>Rebates and Grants:</h3>
      <p><b>Many states and local governments offer rebates or grants to incentivize solar installations. For instance,
          California's Self-Generation Incentive Program (SGIP) provides rebates for qualifying energy storage systems,
          including those paired with solar.</b></p>
      <p><b>According to data from the Database of State Incentives for Renewables & Efficiency (DSIRE), state and local
          incentives have contributed to the growth of residential solar installations. As of 2021, California led the
          nation with over 10 GW of installed residential solar capacity.</b></p>

    <div class="column">
      <h3>Property Tax Exemptions:</h3>
      <p>
        <b>
          Property tax exemptions can significantly reduce the overall cost of solar installations for homeowners and
          businesses. While statistics on the impact of property tax exemptions specifically may vary by jurisdiction,
          they contribute to making solar energy more financially attractive.
