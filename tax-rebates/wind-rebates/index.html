      <h2>What is a government issued tax rebate?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h4>A government-issued tax rebate for green energy is a financial incentive aimed at encouraging investment
            in
            renewable energy sources and energy-efficient technologies. These rebates serve as tools to promote
            sustainability, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and decrease reliance on fossil fuels. Typically, they come
            in
            the form of Investment Tax Credits (ITC) or Production Tax Credits (PTC), allowing individuals or businesses
            to
            deduct a portion of the cost of installing renewable energy systems from their federal income taxes or
            providing
            tax credits for electricity generated from eligible renewable sources. Additionally, governments may offer
            rebates for purchasing energy-efficient appliances, sales tax exemptions for green energy technologies, or
            property tax incentives for renewable energy installations. These measures, tailored to specific eligibility
            criteria and limitations, aim to enhance the affordability and attractiveness of green energy technologies,
            fostering their adoption and contributing to environmental sustainability efforts.</h4>

      <h3>Federal Tax Credits:</h3>
      <p><b>
          <i>Incentive:</i> The federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC) allows homeowners and businesses to deduct a
          percentage of the cost of installing solar panels from their federal taxes.
          <i>Percentage:</i> The ITC originally offered a 26% credit for systems installed in 2020-2022. It decreased
          to 22% for systems installed in 2023 and is expected to reduce further in subsequent years.
          <i>Impact:</i> According to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), the ITC has helped drive
          significant growth in the U.S. solar industry. In 2020, the residential solar market alone added 3.1
          gigawatts (GW) of solar capacity, a 7% increase over the previous year.
      </p></b>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <h3>Rebates and Grants:</h3>
      <p><b>Many states and local governments offer rebates or grants to incentivize solar installations. For instance,
          California's Self-Generation Incentive Program (SGIP) provides rebates for qualifying energy storage systems,
          including those paired with solar.</b></p>
      <p><b>According to data from the Database of State Incentives for Renewables & Efficiency (DSIRE), state and local
          incentives have contributed to the growth of residential solar installations. As of 2021, California led the
          nation with over 10 GW of installed residential solar capacity.</b></p>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <h3>Property Tax Exemptions:</h3>
      <p>
        <b>
          Property tax exemptions can significantly reduce the overall cost of solar installations for homeowners and
          businesses. While statistics on the impact of property tax exemptions specifically may vary by jurisdiction,
          they contribute to making solar energy more financially attractive.

        <ul>
          <li>Solar panels, composed of photovoltaic cells that convert sunlight into electricity through the
            photovoltaic effect, represent a pivotal technology in the quest for sustainable energy solutions. These
            panels, typically constructed with semiconductor materials like silicon, absorb photons from sunlight,
            liberating electrons and generating an electric current. One of their paramount advantages lies in their
            utilization of an infinitely renewable energy source: sunlight. By harnessing solar power, individuals and
            businesses can reduce their carbon footprint and contribute to mitigating climate change, as solar energy
            production produces no greenhouse gas emissions or air pollutants. Moreover, solar panels offer a pathway
            towards energy independence, enabling users to generate their electricity and reduce dependence on
            conventional utility grids and fossil fuels. While initial investment costs can be substantial, the
            long-term benefits in terms of cost savings, environmental stewardship, and grid stability position solar
            panels as a cornerstone of the transition to a sustainable energy future</li>

          <ul>
            <li>Solar panels have a long lifespan, typically around 25 to 30 years, during which they produce clean
              and renewable energy.
            <li>The production of solar panels does require energy and raw materials; however, studies indicate that
              the energy payback period (time to recover the energy used in production) is generally within 1-4 years,
              depending on the panel type and location.</li>
            <li>At the end of their life cycle, solar panels can be recycled, allowing for the recovery of valuable
              materials like silicon, glass, and metals.</li>

    <h2>Why chose Solar Panels</h2>
    <Ul>
      <b>
        <li>Solar panels offer numerous benefits as a green energy source. Firstly, they rely on the sun, a renewable
          resource, ensuring a sustainable energy supply. Unlike fossil fuels, solar energy production does not emit
          greenhouse gases, reducing environmental impact and combating climate change. Solar power provides energy
          independence, allowing individuals and communities to generate their own electricity and reduce reliance on
          centralized grids. Additionally, solar panels offer long-term cost savings by reducing energy bills and
          decreasing dependence on volatile fuel prices. Overall, solar panels present an environmentally friendly,
          economically viable, and sustainable solution for clean energy generation.
