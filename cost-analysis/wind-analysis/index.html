      <h2>How do wind turbines work and who should use them</h2>
      <br>
      <p>
        Wind turbines harness the kinetic energy of the wind and convert it into electrical power. Blades attached to a rotor hub rotate as wind flows past, driving a generator through a shaft. Within the generator, the kinetic energy is transformed into electrical energy through electromagnetic induction, producing alternating current electricity. This electricity can then be transmitted to the grid or stored for later use. Wind turbines are suitable for a diverse range of users including utilities, businesses, farmers, and remote communities, offering a sustainable and renewable energy solution for those seeking to reduce their carbon footprint, lower energy costs, or achieve energy independence.

<h2>Average return on investment (ROI) for Wind Turbines:</h2>
<h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Residential solar PV installations offer a compelling financial proposition with a payback period typically spanning 5 to 10 years, averaging around 7 years. During this time, homeowners can expect to recoup their initial investment through energy savings. Moreover, the return on investment (ROI) is estimated at 5-10% annually over a 20-25 year period, factoring in considerations such as electricity production, maintenance costs, and incentives. This long-term outlook underscores the financial viability of solar energy adoption, as homeowners not only benefit from reduced energy bills but also enjoy steady returns on their investment while contributing to environmental sustainability by reducing reliance on conventional energy sources.
